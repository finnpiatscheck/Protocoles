# Protocoles

### By Finn Piatscheck | 2019

This folder contains the protocoles related to the mocular biology work used for *F. petiolaris*' phylogeographic study. DNA from *Ficus* species can be difficult to work with as many secondary compounds can alter the quality of DNA extractions. CTAB DNA extractions were favored. ddRAD Sequencing was used to obtain genomic loci. As the quality of amplification was varying between samples, PCRs were realized on individuals (instead of pulling samples prior to amplification). Electrophoresis gels were run for each samples to test quality. DNA sequencing was realized on a Illumina HiSeq 3000 at the ISU Sequencing facility. Raw read were processed with ipyrad, genomic analyses were realized in R.
